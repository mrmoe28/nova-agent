# WebPack Build Error Fixes

## Problem
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length') at WasmHash._updateWithBuffer during Vercel build process.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Prisma Generate in Build Script**: Build script didn't include `prisma generate` before `next build`
2. **Complex Next.js Configuration**: Over-configured image settings and file tracing causing WebPack conflicts
3. **Potential Package Compatibility Issues**: Latest Next.js 15.5.5 and React 19.1.0 with older packages

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated Build Script (package.json)
```json
"build": "prisma generate && next build"
```
**Reasoning**: Ensures Prisma client is generated before build, preventing database-related build errors.

### 2. Simplified Next.js Configuration (next.config.ts) 
**Removed**:
- Complex image device sizes and formats configuration
- `outputFileTracingRoot` path configuration  
- Detailed content security policies
- Multiple image optimization settings

**Kept Essential**:
- `serverExternalPackages: ['pdf-parse']` for server components
- Basic remote image patterns for scraped content
- ESLint disable during builds
- SVG support

**Reasoning**: Complex configurations can cause WebPack bundling conflicts, especially with WASM modules.

### 3. Potential Additional Fixes (if issues persist)

#### Problematic Dependencies to Watch:
- `sharp` (v0.34.4) - Image processing with native binaries
- `puppeteer-core` (v24.25.0) - Browser automation with large binary dependencies
- `tesseract.js` (v6.0.1) - WASM-based OCR that can cause WebPack issues
- `unpdf` (v1.3.2) - PDF processing with potential binary conflicts

#### Environment Variable Issues:
Ensure all required environment variables are properly set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `CRON_SECRET`  
- Any API keys for scraping services

#### Vercel Configuration:
Current vercel.json is simplified and should work. If issues persist, try removing function-specific configurations temporarily.

## Verification Steps
1. Test local build: `npm run build`
2. Check for dependency warnings during install
3. Verify Prisma generation works: `npx prisma generate`
4. Deploy to Vercel and monitor build logs

## If Error Persists
1. Try updating to more stable versions of Next.js and React
2. Consider external packages for WASM-heavy dependencies
3. Use Vercel's edge runtime for problematic functions
4. Check for circular imports in the codebase
