8. Enhance OCR accuracy with more utility company patterns
9. Add bill comparison visualization

## Known Issues

- Build has font-related warnings (works fine in dev mode)
- Equipment pricing is mocked data
- OCR accuracy depends on bill format clarity
- **File storage uses /tmp directory in serverless**: Files are ephemeral and deleted after processing (consider Vercel Blob Storage for persistent storage)
- **Image OCR disabled in production**: Tesseract.js requires canvas/DOMMatrix APIs not available in Vercel serverless - PDF files recommended for best results

### Recent Fixes (2025-10-17)

#### Image Upload UX Improvements
**Problem**: Users were unaware when image OCR failed in production, leading to confusion about demo data fallbacks.

**Root Cause**:
1. Tesseract.js OCR disabled in serverless (requires canvas/DOMMatrix APIs)
2. FileUpload component ignored API warnings
3. No visual feedback about OCR processing status
4. Users uploaded images thinking they'd be processed correctly

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Added Sonner toast notifications for upload feedback
2. ✅ Display warnings when OCR fails and fallback data is used
3. ✅ Visual indicators showing OCR status (green checkmark) and fallback data (amber warning icon)
4. ✅ Added prominent messaging recommending PDF files for best accuracy
5. ✅ Enhanced error handling with descriptive toast messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Sonner Toaster component
- `src/components/FileUpload.tsx` - Complete UX overhaul with toast notifications and status indicators
- `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - Installed shadcn/ui Sonner component

**Result**: Users now have clear visibility into upload status and are guided toward using PDF files for optimal OCR results.

#### Product Image Extraction Fix
**Problem**: All 126 equipment items showing placeholder icons instead of product images.

**Root Cause**:
1. Products scraped with `useBrowser=false` (default) which can't extract JS-rendered images
2. Browser scraper with sophisticated image extraction exists but wasn't used
3. All equipment `imageUrl` fields are `null` in database

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Changed `useBrowser` default from `false` to `true` on distributor detail page
2. ✅ Updated checkbox label to "Browser Mode (extracts product images, slower but more accurate)"
3. ✅ Browser mode now pre-checked by default for re-scraping

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/distributors/[id]/page.tsx` - Default browser mode to true, update label

**How to Get Product Images**:
1. Visit any distributor detail page: `/distributors/[id]`
2. Ensure "Browser Mode" checkbox is checked (now default)
3. Click "Rescrape" button
4. Wait for browser scraping to complete (slower but extracts images)
5. Product images will populate in equipment catalog

**Result**: Users can now re-scrape distributors to extract product images using the browser-based scraper with live DOM inspection.

#### Image Display Debugging Fix (2025-10-17 Evening)
**Problem**: User reported "images still not showing after refresh" despite browser mode fix.

**Root Cause** (5-Why Analysis):
1. Why aren't images showing? → Only 3/130 equipment items have imageUrl populated
2. Why do only 3 have imageUrl? → RES Supply (126 items) was scraped without browser mode
3. Why was it scraped without browser mode? → It was scraped at 2:34 PM before browser mode default was enabled
4. Why did user think refresh would fix it? → Misunderstanding - page refresh doesn't rescrape
5. Why couldn't we diagnose faster? → Image onError handler was silently hiding failures

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Added console.error logging to image onError handlers to expose failures
2. ✅ Improved error message from JSX (broken) to proper HTML/SVG
3. ✅ Added "Image unavailable" text to failed image placeholders
4. ✅ Documented exact steps users must take to get images

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/distributors/[id]/page.tsx` - Added error logging and fixed placeholder HTML
- `src/app/distributors/page.tsx` - Added error logging and fixed placeholder HTML

**How to Fix "No Images" Issue**:
1. Visit `/distributors` page
2. Find the distributor with missing images (e.g., "RES Supply")
3. Click on the distributor card to open detail page
4. Ensure "Browser Mode" checkbox is **checked** (now default)
5. Click "Rescrape" button and wait (may take 1-2 minutes for large catalogs)
6. Refresh page after scraping completes
7. Product images will now be populated from live DOM

**Why Page Refresh Doesn't Work**:
- Refreshing only reloads data from database
- Image URLs must be extracted during scraping process
- Rescraping triggers browser automation to extract live DOM image URLs
- Database updates happen during rescrape, not during page refresh

**Result**: Better error visibility and clear user guidance for obtaining product images.

## Notes for Future Development

- **No demo mode**: Real bill uploads with OCR extraction required
- OCR processing is triggered when user clicks "Process Bills & Continue"
- Analysis fails if no OCR data extracted (requires valid bill uploads)
- Extracted bill data includes: kWh usage, kW demand, costs, billing period, account info
- All monetary values in USD
- System sizing uses conservative estimates (1.2x safety factors)
- PDF save path: Browser download (not server-side save)
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (serverless/production-ready)
- **File uploads stored in `/tmp/uploads/{projectId}/`** (serverless environment)
  - Files in `/tmp` are ephemeral and deleted after function execution
  - OCR processing should happen immediately after upload
  - For production scale, consider Vercel Blob Storage or AWS S3

## OCR Implementation Details

### Libraries Used
- **pdf-parse**: Fast, native PDF text extraction for digital PDFs (works in serverless)
- **tesseract.js**: JavaScript OCR for scanned images - **DISABLED in production serverless environments** due to canvas/DOMMatrix dependency issues

### Serverless Considerations
- **Production (Vercel)**: Image OCR disabled - Tesseract.js requires browser DOM APIs (DOMMatrix, canvas) not available in Node.js serverless
- **Local Development**: Full OCR support for all file types
- **Recommended**: Use PDF bills in production for best results
- **Fix Applied**: Dynamic import with environment detection to prevent crashes

### Supported File Types
- PDF (text-based and scanned)
- Images (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- CSV (direct text parsing)

### Data Extraction Patterns
Regex patterns extract:
- Energy usage: `(\d+(?:,\d+)?)\s*kWh` with total usage variants
- Demand: `(?:peak\s*)?demand[:\s]*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*kW`
- Costs: Total amount, energy charges, demand charges
- Billing info: Period dates, account numbers
- Utility companies: PG&E, Duke Energy, SCE, Con Edison, etc.

### API Flow
1. Upload bill → `/api/upload` (saves file, creates DB record)
2. Process OCR → `/api/ocr` POST (extracts text, parses data, updates DB)
3. Analyze → `/api/analyze` (aggregates OCR data from all bills, calculates metrics)

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Bill {
  ocrText       String?  // Raw extracted text
  extractedData String?  // JSON string of ParsedBillData
}
```

### Bug Fixes - OCR and Distributor Equipment (2025-10-17)

#### Issue 1: Bill Upload OCR Failures
**Problem**: Bill upload succeeds but OCR processing completely fails with multiple fallback errors.

**Symptoms**:
- Claude AI PDF extraction: `APIConnectionError: Connection error` / `ETIMEDOUT`
- PDF fallback extraction: `TypeError: pdfParse is not a function`
- Users see "Using demo data for analysis" warnings
- All bills default to fallback demo data

**Root Cause Analysis (DEBUG Protocol)**:

1. **Primary Issue - pdf-parse ESM/CommonJS Import Failure**:
   - Location: `src/lib/ocr.ts:80-84`
   - Code attempted: `const require = createRequire(import.meta.url); const pdfParse = require('pdf-parse')`
   - Problem: pdf-parse v2.4.3 is pure ESM module, CommonJS require() fails
   - Error: `TypeError: pdfParse is not a function`

2. **Secondary Issue - Claude API Network Failures**:
   - Error: `APIConnectionError: Connection error` with `fetch failed` and `ETIMEDOUT`
   - Intermittent network/API connectivity issues
   - When Claude fails, falls back to broken pdf-parse

**Solution Implemented**:

```typescript
// src/lib/ocr.ts

// ✅ BEFORE (broken):
import { createRequire } from 'module'
const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const pdfParse = require('pdf-parse')  // ❌ Fails - not a function
const pdfData = await pdfParse(dataBuffer)  // ❌ TypeError

// ✅ AFTER (fixed):
import { PDFParse } from 'pdf-parse'  // Named import from ESM

export async function extractTextFromPDF(filePath: string): Promise<OCRResult> {
  const dataBuffer = await readFile(filePath)
  const parser = new PDFParse({ data: dataBuffer })  // Create instance with data
  const textResult = await parser.getText()  // Extract text
  await parser.destroy()  // Clean up
  
  return {
    text: textResult.text,
    pageCount: textResult.total,
    confidence: 0.95,
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/ocr.ts` - Fixed pdf-parse import and usage (lines 1-96)

**Result**: PDF text extraction now works as fallback when Claude AI is unavailable. Users get accurate bill data instead of demo fallback.

#### Issue 2: Duplicate Equipment After Rescraping Distributors
**Problem**: After rescraping a distributor, images appear showing old products alongside new products, creating duplicates.

**Symptoms**:
- User rescrapes distributor → Equipment count doubles
- Old products with images remain in database
- New scraped products added (possibly without images if HTTP mode used)
- Result: 20 products showing (10 old + 10 new duplicates)

**Root Cause Analysis (DEBUG Protocol)**:

1. **No Upsert Logic**:
   - Location: `src/app/api/distributors/scrape-from-url/route.ts:242-289`
   - Code: Always calls `prisma.equipment.create()` for new products
   - Never checks if equipment already exists
   - Never updates existing equipment records

2. **Why Images Persist**:
   - Old equipment records stay in database with `imageUrl` populated
   - New scrape creates duplicate equipment (possibly with `imageUrl: null`)
   - Both old and new records displayed to user

**Solution Implemented**:

```typescript
// src/app/api/distributors/scrape-from-url/route.ts

// ✅ BEFORE (broken - always creates):
for (const product of scrapedProducts) {
  const equipment = await prisma.equipment.create({
    data: { /* ... */ imageUrl: product.imageUrl || null }
  })
}

// ✅ AFTER (fixed - upserts):
for (const product of scrapedProducts) {
  const category = detectCategory(product)
  
  // Try to find existing equipment by sourceUrl or modelNumber
  const whereConditions = [
    product.sourceUrl ? { sourceUrl: product.sourceUrl } : null,
    { modelNumber: product.modelNumber || product.name.substring(0, 50) }
  ].filter((condition): condition is { sourceUrl: string } | { modelNumber: string } => condition !== null)

  const existingEquipment = await prisma.equipment.findFirst({
    where: {
      distributorId: savedDistributor.id,
      OR: whereConditions,
    }
  })
  
  let equipment
  if (existingEquipment) {
    // UPDATE existing equipment (preserve old image if new scrape has none)
    equipment = await prisma.equipment.update({
      where: { id: existingEquipment.id },
      data: {
        name: product.name,
        unitPrice: product.price,
        imageUrl: product.imageUrl || existingEquipment.imageUrl,  // ✅ Keep old image!
        lastScrapedAt: new Date(),
        // ...
      },
    })
  } else {
    // CREATE new equipment
    equipment = await prisma.equipment.create({
      data: { /* ... */ }
    })
  }
}
```

**Key Features of Fix**:
1. ✅ **Upsert Logic**: Updates existing equipment, creates only if new
2. ✅ **Smart Matching**: Matches by `sourceUrl` (most reliable) or `modelNumber`
3. ✅ **Image Preservation**: Keeps old image if new scrape doesn't have one (`product.imageUrl || existingEquipment.imageUrl`)
4. ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript filtering without `any` type
5. ✅ **Price History**: Still creates price snapshots for tracking

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/distributors/scrape-from-url/route.ts` - Added upsert logic (lines 242-324)

**Result**: 
- No more duplicate equipment after rescraping
- Images preserved from previous scrapes
- Price history tracked correctly
- Equipment details updated with latest information

---

**Verification**:
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Both fixes tested and validated

**Prevention**:
- Added proper ESM imports for all modules
- Implemented upsert patterns for all database writes where duplicates possible
- Added logging to track update vs create operations

---

## Error Fix: 2025-10-17 - Build Failure Causing 405 API Errors

### Error
```
Failed to compile.

./check-scrape-history.ts:11:7
Type error: Type '{ distributor: { select: { name: true; }; }; }' is not assignable to type 'never'.

HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) on /api/upload
Error uploading file: SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input
```

### Root Cause
1. **Build Failure**: The `check-scrape-history.ts` file in the project root was being included in the Next.js build
2. **Missing Prisma Relation**: The `CrawlJob` model had a `distributorId` field but no relation to the `Distributor` model
3. **TypeScript Error**: Prisma query tried to include a non-existent relation, causing TypeScript compilation to fail
4. **API Route Impact**: When the build fails, API routes don't get compiled properly, causing 405 errors

### Solution

**1. Fixed Prisma Schema** - Added missing CrawlJob ↔ Distributor relation:

`prisma/schema.prisma`:
```prisma
model CrawlJob {
  // ... existing fields
  distributor       Distributor? @relation(fields: [distributorId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
}

model Distributor {
  // ... existing fields
  crawlJobs       CrawlJob[]
}
```

**2. Excluded Script from Build** - Moved utility script and updated TypeScript config:

```bash
# Move script to scripts folder
mkdir -p scripts
mv check-scrape-history.ts scripts/
```

`tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "scripts"]
}
```

**3. Regenerated Prisma Client**:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npm run build
```

### Verification
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ All API routes compiled successfully (`/api/upload` visible in build output)
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ ESLint passes
- ✅ Dev server starts successfully

### Prevention
1. **Always exclude utility scripts** from TypeScript compilation by placing in `scripts/` folder
2. **Define all Prisma relations** explicitly when fields reference other models
3. **Run `npm run build`** before deploying to catch compilation errors early
4. **Check build output** to verify API routes are compiled

### Files Modified
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added CrawlJob-Distributor relation
- `tsconfig.json` - Excluded scripts folder from compilation
- Moved `check-scrape-history.ts` → `scripts/check-scrape-history.ts`

### Result
- API upload endpoint now works correctly
- No more 405 errors
- Build completes successfully
- All API routes functional
