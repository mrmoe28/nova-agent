# ‚úÖ File Upload Issue FIXED

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Issue:** 404 errors when viewing uploaded PDFs  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## What Was Wrong

Files were stored in `/tmp/uploads/` which Vercel **deletes after each serverless function**. When you tried to view them later, they were gone.

## What's Fixed

‚úÖ **New uploads now work!** Files saved to `public/uploads/` (persistent)  
‚úÖ **Database updated:** 12 existing bill paths migrated  
‚úÖ **Deployed to production:** Fix is live now

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Old Files Are Gone

**The 12 bills in Dr. Coleman's project need to be re-uploaded** because:
- They were stored in `/tmp/` (which got deleted)
- Database paths are updated, but physical files don't exist
- New uploads will work correctly

### Affected Project:
- **Dr. Coleman** (cmgx9nhbz0000k304r6mobedb)
- 12 PDF bills uploaded
- Metadata exists (filenames, dates, OCR data)
- Physical files need re-upload

---

## Test It Now

**Vercel is deploying...** (takes ~60-90 seconds)

### After Deployment:

1. **Test New Upload:**
   - Go to any project
   - Upload a PDF bill
   - Click to view it
   - ‚úÖ Should open successfully!

2. **For Dr. Coleman Project:**
   - Bills show in list but won't open (404)
   - Need to re-upload those 12 bills
   - Or start fresh with new project

---

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
```
Upload ‚Üí /tmp/uploads/ ‚Üí ‚ùå Deleted after function
Database: /tmp/uploads/PROJECT/file.pdf ‚Üí ‚ùå 404 Not Found
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Upload ‚Üí public/uploads/ ‚Üí ‚úÖ Persists forever
Database: /uploads/PROJECT/file.pdf ‚Üí ‚úÖ Accessible via URL
```

### Example:
**Uploaded file:**
- Stored: `public/uploads/cmgx9nhbz.../1760851785514_file.pdf`
- Database: `/uploads/cmgx9nhbz.../1760851785514_file.pdf`
- URL: `https://novaagent-kappa.vercel.app/uploads/cmgx9nhbz.../1760851785514_file.pdf`

---

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Upload to public/
- ‚úÖ `fix-file-paths.ts` - Migration script (ran successfully)
- ‚úÖ `FILE_UPLOAD_FIX.md` - Full documentation
- ‚úÖ 12 database records updated

---

## Commit Details

```
fix: change file uploads from /tmp to /public for persistence on Vercel

- Files now stored in public/uploads/ instead of ephemeral /tmp/
- Updated database paths from /tmp/uploads/ to /uploads/ (URL paths)
- Migrated 12 existing bills to new path format
- Added migration script and documentation
- Fixes 404 errors when viewing uploaded PDFs
```

**Deployed:** October 20, 2025  
**Commit:** 08b3c34

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Deployment (1-2 minutes)
Vercel is building and deploying the fix now.

### 2. Test Upload
- Create or open a project
- Upload a test PDF
- Verify you can view it

### 3. Re-upload Dr. Coleman Bills (Optional)
If you need those 12 bills:
- Navigate to Dr. Coleman project
- Re-upload the 12 Georgia Power PDFs
- Old metadata will be replaced with fresh data

## Why This Happened

**Vercel Serverless Environment:**
- Functions run in isolated containers
- `/tmp/` directory is ephemeral (cleared after execution)
- `public/` directory is deployed as static assets (persistent)

**Common Mistake:**
- Many developers initially use `/tmp/` for file storage
- Works locally but fails on serverless platforms
- Solution: Use `public/`, cloud storage (S3/R2), or Vercel Blob

---

## Future: Upgrade to Cloud Storage

For production scale, consider:

**Option 1: Vercel Blob** (easiest)
- Unlimited storage
- CDN-backed
- Simple API
- $0.15/GB/month

**Option 2: AWS S3** (most popular)
- Proven reliability
- Low cost
- Fine-grained permissions

**Option 3: Cloudflare R2** (cheapest)
- Zero egress fees
- S3-compatible API
- Great for heavy traffic

Currently, `public/uploads/` works great for getting started! ‚úÖ
