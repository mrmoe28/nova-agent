# Deployment Error Fix

## Error Description

**Error Type:** TypeScript Compilation Errors Blocking Vercel Deployment  
**Date Fixed:** October 20, 2025

## Symptoms

- Vercel deployment fails with TypeScript errors
- Build command `npm run build` fails
- Error messages:
  - `Cannot find name 'setEditedSystem'` in review page
  - Missing module `'../../src/lib/test-fixtures'` in integration tests
  - Type errors with implicit 'any' types in test files

## Root Cause

1. **Undefined Function References**: After resolving merge conflicts, the review page had calls to `setEditedSystem()` but the state variable was never defined
2. **Test Files in Build**: Integration test files with incomplete fixtures and type errors were being included in TypeScript compilation during build
3. **Merge Conflict Resolution**: When rebasing changes, the remote version of files was accepted which included incomplete code

## Solution

### 1. Remove Undefined Function Calls

Removed unnecessary calls to `setEditedSystem(null)` in two locations in `/src/app/wizard/[projectId]/review/page.tsx`:
- Line 85 in `handleCancelEdit()` function
- Line 259 after successful system update

These calls were artifacts from merge conflict resolution and the variable was never actually used.

### 2. Exclude Test Files from Build

Updated `tsconfig.json` to exclude test files from TypeScript compilation:

```json
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "scripts", "tests"]
}
```

This ensures that test-only code with incomplete fixtures or development dependencies doesn't block production builds.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/wizard/[projectId]/review/page.tsx` - Removed 2 undefined function calls
2. `/tsconfig.json` - Added "tests" to exclude array

## Verification Steps

1. **TypeScript Compilation:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   Should complete without errors

2. **Build Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Should complete successfully

3. **Check Deployment:**
   - Push to GitHub triggers automatic Vercel deployment
   - Check https://novaagent-kappa.vercel.app/ for successful deployment
   - Monitor Vercel dashboard for build status

## Related Errors

If you encounter similar deployment errors in the future:

1. **Check TypeScript Compilation First:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **Review Merge Conflicts Carefully:**
   - Don't blindly accept "theirs" or "ours" during conflicts
   - Verify all variable/function references are defined
   - Test compilation after resolving conflicts

3. **Separate Test Code from Production:**
   - Keep test files in `/tests` directory
   - Use separate `tsconfig.test.json` if needed
   - Ensure test dependencies don't leak into production builds

## Prevention

1. **Pre-commit Checks:**
   ```bash
   # Add to pre-commit hook
   npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint
   ```

2. **CI/CD Validation:**
   - Run full build in CI before merging
   - Add TypeScript compilation check to PR workflow

3. **Merge Conflict Protocol:**
   - Always compile after resolving conflicts
   - Run tests before pushing
   - Use `git status` to verify no unintended changes

## Deployment Pipeline

Current deployment flow:
1. Push to GitHub `main` branch
2. Vercel automatically detects push
3. Runs `npm run build` (includes `prisma generate`)
4. TypeScript compilation must pass
5. Next.js build must complete
6. Deploy to production
