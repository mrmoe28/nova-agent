# Database Migration 500 Error - RESOLVED ✅

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅
**Severity:** Critical - Production Outage

---

## 🚨 Error Summary

**Symptoms:**
- Production `/api/projects` endpoint returning 500 error
- Error message: `"Failed to fetch projects"`
- Projects page stuck on "Loading Projects..." spinner

**Root Cause:**
Database schema out of sync with Prisma schema. Missing column `BOMItem.imageUrl` in production database.

**Exact Error:**
```
Error [PrismaClientKnownRequestError]:
Invalid `prisma.project.findMany()` invocation:
The column `BOMItem.imageUrl` does not exist in the current database.
Code: P2022
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened?

1. **Schema Changes**: Code was updated to include `imageUrl` and `sourceUrl` columns in `BOMItem` table
2. **Migration Created**: Migration `20251021203500_add_imageurl_to_bomitem` was created
3. **Migration Not Applied**: The migration existed in codebase but was never applied to production database
4. **Failed Migration Blocking**: A previous failed migration (`20251027000000_create_project_status_enum`) was blocking all new migrations

### Why It Failed?

The `ProjectStatus` enum migration had failed previously because:
- The enum already existed in the database
- The migration tried to create it again
- This marked the migration as "failed" in Prisma's migration tracking
- Prisma refuses to apply new migrations when there are failed ones

---

## 🛠️ Fix Applied

### Step 1: Resolved Failed Migration
```bash
# Mark the failed enum migration as rolled back
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251027000000_create_project_status_enum

# Since the enum actually exists, mark it as applied
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 20251027000000_create_project_status_enum
```

### Step 2: Cleaned Up Empty Migration Directory
```bash
# Remove migration directory without SQL file
rm -rf prisma/migrations/20251021173110_add_imageurl_to_bomitem
```

### Step 3: Applied Pending Migrations
```bash
# Deploy all pending migrations to production
DATABASE_URL="<production-db-url>" npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Migration Applied:**
```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "BOMItem" ADD COLUMN "imageUrl" TEXT;
```

## ✅ Verification

### Local Testing
```bash
✅ npm run dev - Server starts successfully
✅ curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects - Returns projects data
✅ Database schema is up to date
```

### Production Testing
```bash
✅ curl https://novaagent-kappa.vercel.app/api/projects - Returns {"success":true}
✅ Projects page loads successfully
✅ No 500 errors in production logs
```

## 🔐 Prevention Measures

### 1. Added Vercel Build Hook for Migrations
**Issue:** Migrations weren't running automatically on deploy

**Solution:** Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build"
  }
}
```

⚠️ **DO NOT** add `prisma migrate deploy` to the build script on Vercel. This can cause race conditions and build failures. Instead, run migrations manually or use Vercel's pre-build hooks.

### 2. Migration Status Check
**Best Practice:** Before deploying, always check migration status:
```bash
# Check what migrations are pending
npx prisma migrate status

# Apply pending migrations to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### 3. Database Schema Validation
**Added to CI/CD:** Run schema validation in CI before deployment
```bash
# Validate schema matches database
npx prisma validate
```

### 4. Failed Migration Recovery Documentation
**Documentation Added:** Steps to recover from failed migrations:
1. Identify failed migration: `npx prisma migrate status`
2. Check if changes were actually applied to DB
3. If applied: `npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration>`
4. If not applied: `npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration>`
5. Then: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Apply Migrations to Production
- **Issue:** Migrations created but not deployed
- **Solution:** Make migration deployment part of deployment checklist
- **Prevention:** Consider automated migration deployment (with caution)

### 2. Monitor Migration Status
- **Issue:** Failed migrations blocking progress
- **Solution:** Regular `prisma migrate status` checks
- **Prevention:** Add migration status to deployment health checks

### 3. Database Schema Must Match Code
- **Issue:** Code expects columns that don't exist
- **Solution:** Keep migrations in sync with deployments
- **Prevention:** Run migrations before deploying code changes

### 4. Handle Failed Migrations Properly
- **Issue:** Failed migrations left in "failed" state
- **Solution:** Proper resolution using `migrate resolve`
- **Prevention:** Test migrations in staging first

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist (Updated)

Before every deployment:
- [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate status` to check for pending migrations
- [ ] Apply migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Test API endpoints locally with production database
- [ ] Verify no failed migrations exist
- [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Test production endpoints after deployment
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for errors
